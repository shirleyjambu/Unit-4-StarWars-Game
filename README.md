The StarWars Game

The StarWars Game is a fun project built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.

Game Instructions:

When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. The player will fight as that character for the rest of the game.

   * The player must then defeat all of the remaining fighters. Enemies would be moved to a different area of the screen.

   * The player should choose an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.

   * Once the player selects an opponent, that enemy is moved to a `defender area`.

   * The player will now be able to click the `attack` button.
     * Whenever the player clicks `attack`, their character damages the defender. The opponent will lose `HP` (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture. 
     * The opponent character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their `HP`. These points are shown at the bottom of the player character's picture.

3. The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.

   * When the defender's `HP` is reduced to zero or below, the enemy will be removed from the `defender area`. The player character can now choose a new opponent.

4. The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The player loses the game the game if their character's `HP` falls to zero or below.

5. Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power. 
  * For example, if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase the Attack Power by 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on). 
  
6. The enemy character only has `Counter Attack Power`.  Unlike the player's `Attack Points`, `Counter Attack Power` never changes.

7. A winning player must pick their characters wisely by first fighting an enemy with low `Counter Attack Power`. This will allow them to grind `Attack Power` and to take on enemies before they lose all of their `Health Points`. 


Enjoy the Game!
